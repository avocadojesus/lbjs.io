Welcome to lbjs the JavaScript meetup for the Long Beach developer community! The purpose of this post is to propose the structure of the future lbjs meetups.
## general info
The lbjs site is built with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the source code for the site is located on my github [github.com/schmittyjd/lbjs.io](https://github.com/schmittyjd/lbjs.io)

This site/repo will serve as the hub for all lbjs meetup announcements/descriptions. Each monthly meetup will be a jekyll markdown post. If anybody ever wants to submit an idea for a talk they can fork the repo, add a description of their talk to the proper post, and submit a pull request.

## Meetup format
This is a JavaScript meetup so talks should be in some way about JavaScript (although exceptions can be made). Nerdy developer talks about JavaScript will be the bread and butter of this meetup.

The chronological formatting of the meetup can always be subject to change, but for now I propose a format similar to the local [Wapro](http://wapro.lbtech.org) meetup.
1. Networking (10-15min)
2. Main talk (10-20min)
3. Main talk (10-20min)
4. Main talk (10-20min)
5. Lightning Talks, disscussion/debate (10-20min)
6. More Networking (10-30min)

## First meetup date and location
TBA (Coming soon!)

## Sponsors?
TBA
